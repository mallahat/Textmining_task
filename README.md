# Textmining_task
i will go through other csv files and try to find the correlation between them according to topics.
i also like to check the frequency of most repeated words by their id in each csv file.
I want to further explore the csv files to see how i can split data into groups in the best way. I will decide if they can be labled(classification) or i need to find similarity between some groups(clustering). maybe the data is very chaotic that in this case i will apply PCA(demension reduction) to decide. but this data does not look so chaotic in my opinion.
train test fit and compare the accuracy results.
I try to take a deep look at the data and explore it to see how it fits into different ML-Models.(Random forest, SVM, ...)
